#### Suggested Actions
1. **Investigate Non-Responsive Hosts**: The large number of hosts not responding should be investigated to ensure inactive or decommissioned systems are properly managed.
2. **Review Configurations**: For hosts that are up, configurations should be reviewed to ensure they adhere to network security policies, especially around open ports and services.
3. **Security Enhancements**: Implement or enhance intrusion detection systems (IDS) and use comprehensive firewall rules to manage and monitor the traffic more efficiently.
