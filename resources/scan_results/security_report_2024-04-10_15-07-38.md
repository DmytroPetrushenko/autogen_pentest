## Security Report: Host Discovery Scan

### Scan Summary
- **Task Performed**: Host discovery without port scanning
- **IP Range**: 63.251.228.0/24
- **Total IP Addresses Scanned**: 256
- **Hosts Discovered Up**: 11

### Observations
- Most hosts (245 out of 256) in the target range are either not active or not responding to the ping requests.
- Of the 11 active hosts, none had open ports listed as no port scans were performed. Active hosts did not reveal specific operating system details or open ports, indicating a blocked or silent response to such inquiries.

### Active Hosts and States
- **63.251.228.1**: Host up, connection refused
- **63.251.228.28**: Host up, SYN-ACK received
- **63.251.228.30**: Host up, connection refused, identified as `ns-sj.portera.com`
- **63.251.228.41**: Host up, SYN-ACK received, identified as `eqxeisopenl01.eqx.exigengroup.com`
- **63.251.228.69**: Host up, SYN-ACK received
- **63.251.228.70**: Host up, SYN-ACK received
- **63.251.228.74**: Host up, SYN-ACK received, identified as `sfo-eis-proxy01.eqxdev.exigengroup.com`
- **63.251.228.119**: Host up, SYN-ACK received
- **63.251.228.120**: Host up, SYN-ACK received
- **63.251.228.252**: Host up, connection refused, identified as `Lo2.EQX-VPN-2a.net.exigengroup.com`
- **63.251.228.253**: Host up, connection refused, identified as `test-dd.portera.com`

### Security Recommendations and Next Steps
1. **Investigate Hosts with Active Response**: Especially for those hosts that responded with SYN-ACK, as these may have services listening on unspecified ports.
2. **Follow-up Scans**: Conduct specific port scanning on the active hosts to ascertain potential entry points for security threats.
3. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Especially towards the active hosts to detect any abnormal behavior or intrusion attempts.
4. **Implement Network Segmentation**: Enhance security by segmenting the network, especially separating the actively responding hosts from those that are not responding.

### Conclusion
The scan provides a concise picture of the network assets within the specified range, highlighting a small number of active devices. For further security assurance, detailed inspections and continuous monitoring are recommended.

The above analysis will be followed by compiling and writing the security report to a file using the Writer To File Tool, ensuring thorough documentation and access to the findings for review and action.
