### Security Report: Network Discovery - IP Range 63.251.228.0/24

#### Background
Performed a passive host discovery (ping scan) on the IP range 63.251.228.0/24 without port scanning to identify potentially reachable hosts within the specified network block.

#### Summary of Findings
The scan results indicated the following host states:
- **11 hosts were identified as "up"**, indicating they responded to the ping scan.
- The remaining hosts were reported as "down" due to no ping responses.

#### Details of Active Hosts
The list of active IP addresses includes:
1. `63.251.228.1` - **State: Up** - No specific services identified.
2. `63.251.228.28` - **State: Up** - No specific services identified.
3. `63.251.228.30` - **State: Up** - Identified hostname: `ns-sj.portera.com`.
4. `63.251.228.41` - **State: Up** - Identified hostname: `eqxeisopenl01.eqx.exigengroup.com`.
5. `63.251.228.69` - **State: Up** - No specific services identified.
6. `63.251.228.70` - **State: Up** - No specific services identified.
7. `63.251.228.74` - **State: Up** - Identified hostname: `sfo-eis-proxy01.eqxdev.exigengroup.com`.
8. `63.251.228.119` - **State: Up** - No specific services identified.
9. `63.251.228.120` - **State: Up** - No specific services identified.
10. `63.251.228.252` - **State: Up** - Identified hostname: `Lo2.EQX-VPN-2a.net.exigengroup.com`.
11. `63.251.228.253` - **State: Up** - Identified hostname: `test-dd.portera.com`.

#### Observations
- Hosts reported as "up" did not have open ports in this scanning phase, which restricts the analysis of their network services and potential vulnerabilities at the port/services level.
- Hosts that are up could potentially serve different applications or services; detailed port scans and vulnerability assessments should be considered for a deeper security analysis.

#### Recommendations
1. **Targeted Port Scanning:** A detailed port and service scan should be conducted on active hosts to understand exposure better.
2. **Vulnerability Assessment:** Following port scans, a vulnerability assessment is recommended to determine potential risks associated with services running on these hosts.
3. **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement regular monitoring and scanning to quickly detect any changes and respond to new threats.

#### Security Tools and Practices
- Utilized Nmap for network discovery.
- Recommended alignment with OWASP guidelines for comprehensive application and network security assessments moving forward.
