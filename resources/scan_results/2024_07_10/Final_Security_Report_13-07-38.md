### Final Security Report Summary

**Web Server Vulnerabilities**:
- **IIS Shortname Scanner**:
  - Discovered readable short names revealing sensitive directories and files on the server:
    - Directory: http://192.168.56.101/aspnet*
    - Files: http://192.168.56.101/index*~1.htm*, http://192.168.56.101/six_of*~1.zip*, http://192.168.56.101/seven_*~1.htm*.
- **MS15-034 (HTTP.sys Memory Dump)**:
  - Identified memory dump vulnerability. Full memory dump was successfully retrieved, indicating elevated risk of information disclosure.

**Database Assessment (MySQL on Port 3306)**:
- The server is running MySQL version 5.5.20-log, which is outdated and may be vulnerable to multiple known exploits.
- Additionally, failed password dumping due to the requirement for specific USERNAME and PASSWORD, which suggests better configurations against unauthorized access but still requires a known account for deeper testing.

**Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) - Port 3389 Vulnerability**:
- The RDP BlueKeep vulnerability (CVE-2019-0708) is present, posing a significant risk of remote code execution.

### Recommendations:
1. **Web Server**:
- Update the IIS server to the latest version to mitigate known vulnerabilities and disable short file name creation on the server.
- Review configuration settings to ensure proper security measures are employed to prevent unauthorized file and directory listings.

2. **Database Security**:
- Update MySQL to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Consider strengthening authentication mechanisms and ensure that database credentials are secure and limited only to necessary applications.

3. **RDP Service**:
- Immediately apply the available patches for the BlueKeep vulnerability to prevent potential remote exploits.
- Limit RDP access to trusted networks and use VPNs and other secure methods for remote administration.

### Critical Notes:
- Immediate actions are necessary for the identified issues to prevent potential exploitation which could lead to data loss, data theft, and unauthorized system access.

### Conclusion:
This security assessment has highlighted critical vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure that require urgent attention. Implementing the recommended steps is crucial for securing the network and protecting sensitive data.
