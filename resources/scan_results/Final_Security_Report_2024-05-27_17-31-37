### Final Security Report:

#### Network Scan Summary
- **Total IP Addresses Scanned**: 256
- **Hosts Responded**: 11
- **Hosts Not Responded**: 245

#### Identified Active Hosts:
1. 63.251.228.252 - *Hostname*: Lo2.EQX-VPN-2a.net.exigengroup.com - Connection refused
2. 63.251.228.253 - *Hostname*: test-dd.portera.com - Connection refused
3. 63.251.228.30 - *Hostname*: ns-sj.portera.com - Connection refused
4. 63.251.228.41 - *Hostname*: eqxeisopenl01.eqx.exigengroup.com - SYN-ACK
5. 63.251.228.74 - *Hostname*: sfo-eis-proxy01.eqxdev.exigengroup.com - SYN-ACK

#### Security Observations:
- **Large Number of Unresponsive Hosts**: May indicate network issues, stringent security measures, or non-operational systems.
- **Active Refusals and SYN-ACK**: Indicates some form of host activity; however, without further scans, we cannot specify potential vulnerabilities.

#### Recommendations:
- **Elevate Permissions for Detailed Scans**: It is crucial to perform deeper dives with appropriate administrative permissions to evaluate the exposed hosts further.
- **Review Network Configurations**: For non-responsive hosts, verifying network setups and health is vital to ensuring complete security control.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Implement comprehensive, periodic reviews of network security to prevent possible intrusions or breakdowns.
