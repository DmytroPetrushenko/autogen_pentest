### Security Report Summary
**Date of Scan:** April 15, 2024  
**Total Hosts Scanned:** 256  
**Hosts Up:** 11  
**Scan Duration:** 50.43 seconds  
**Tool Used:** Nmap 7.94  

### Detailed Findings

#### Host State Details:
- **Majority of Hosts (245)**: Down - No response was obtained which usually indicates that the hosts are either down or not reachable due to network isolation or strict firewall rules.
- **Hosts with Connection Refused (4)**: Indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. This typically means the port on the machine is open, but there are firewall rules or other restrictions preventing access.
  - `63.251.228.4`
  - `63.251.228.30` - `ns-sj.portera.com`
  - `63.251.228.252` - `Lo2.EQX-VPN-2a.net.exigengroup.com`
  - `63.251.228.253` - `test-dd.portera.com`
- **Hosts with 'SYN-ACK' (7)**: Indicates that the port on the server is listening and active.
  - `63.251.228.28`
  - `63.251.228.41` - `eqxeisopenl01.eqx.exigengroup.com`
  - `63.251.228.69`
  - `63.251.228.70`
  - `63.251.228.74` - `sfo-eis-proxy01.eqxdev.exigengroup.com`
  - `63.251.228.119`
  - `63.251.228.120`

### Security Risk Assessment
- **Network Visibility:** A large number of hosts without response could suggest stringent security measures which is positive for preventing unauthorized access. However, it could also indicate potential issues in the network connectivity or misconfigured hosts which should be investigated.
- **Connection Refusals:** The hosts which are up but refuse connection could denote strict access control policies, which is a good security practice but might result in service accessibility issues for legitimate users.
- **Active Listening Ports:** The presence of hosts with active listening ports represents potential entry points for attackers, depending on which services are running on these ports. It is crucial to ensure that only necessary ports are exposed and are adequately protected with proper security mechanisms like firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

### Recommendations
- **Thorough Network Audit:** Conduct a detailed audit to validate that all non-responsive hosts are intentionally shut down or isolated. Ensure network configurations and firewalls settings are optimized for both security and accessibility.
- **Service Verification:** For hosts with connection refusal or active responses, verify that the services running on these hosts are indeed necessary for business operations, and ensure they are up-to-date.
- **Security Enhancements:** For active hosts, consider implementing enhanced monitoring systems to detect unusual network traffic or unauthorized access attempts. Employ comprehensive penetration testing to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion
The scan results provide a foundational overview of the networkâ€™s current state. Careful analysis and rectification of highlighted issues will bolster the network's robustness against external threats. Ensuring operational integrity and security will require ongoing efforts and habitual network scans to adapt to evolving security challenges.
