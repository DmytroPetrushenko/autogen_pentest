**Website Security Report**

**Website URL:** `http://34.255.120.103:4280/`

**1. Directory Listing and Scanner Results:**
   - **/config/** - Found with a `403 Forbidden` response. Potential misconfiguration exposes this directory without proper permissions, suggesting it's not publicly listable but might be improperly secured against deeper probing.
   - **/database/** - Shares the same issue as `/config/`. It's visible but not accessible without proper permissions, pointing towards a potential security risk if the enforcement isn't robust.
   - **/docs/** and **/external/** - Both directories are listed but have a `403 Forbidden` access level; this requires further manual testing to understand the depth of directory listing or misconfigurations.
   - Newly discovered directories during the second round:
     - **/icons/** and **/tests/** - Also returned a `403 Forbidden` response stressing the need for tighter server configuration and access control.

**2. Vulnerabilities Detected:**
   - Multiple endpoints with severe potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and file inclusions were auto-discovered which are typically high-risk in nature.
   - Improper HTTP method configurations were seen across several pages, signifying weak HTTP security policies.

**3. Recommendations:**
   - **Server Configuration:** Immediate review of server access controls and permissions, particularly for critical directories like `/config/` and `/database/`.
   - **Security Policies:** Implement or fortify existing HTTP security headers to mitigate common attacks such as XSS or clickjacking.
   - **Manual Testing:** Further manual testing is recommended for listed vulnerabilities to verify and potentially exploit them under controlled circumstances to understand the security posture better.
   - **Automated Scans:** Regularly scheduled scans with updated rulesets to catch evolving threats or misconfigurations.

**Conclusion:**
The website has several potential security risks primarily around directory exposure and high-risk application vulnerabilities. Immediate action should be taken to assess these findings through detailed audits and implementing stronger security measures to protect the data and integrity of the web application infrastructure.
