# Network Scanning and Security Reporting Agent powered by Autogen

This agent is designed with the primary goal of conducting comprehensive network scans using a variety of tools, from general to specific, and compiling a detailed security report based on the scan results. It aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the network's security posture, identifying vulnerabilities, potential threats, and suggesting remediation steps.

## Overview

The Network Scanning and Security Reporting Agent is an advanced solution for IT security professionals and network administrators. It automates the process of scanning network assets, utilizing a suite of tools to cover a broad spectrum of security checks. The agent streamlines the collection and aggregation of scan data, ultimately generating a consolidated security report that offers valuable insights into the network's security health.

### Features

- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Leverages multiple scanning tools to cover a wide range of security assessments, from surface-level sweeps to deep-dive analyses.
- **Automated Reporting**: Automatically compiles results from various scans into a unified security report, highlighting critical vulnerabilities and anomalies.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides detailed recommendations for mitigating identified risks, enhancing the network's overall security.

## Getting Started

To deploy and use the Network Scanning and Security Reporting Agent in your environment, follow the steps outlined below:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary permissions and access to deploy scanning tools across the network assets you intend to analyze. Some tools may require specific configurations or environments to run effectively.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine or server where the agent will be deployed:

         git clone https://example.com/network-scanning-agent.git

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

         cd network-scanning-agent
         pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure the agent by editing the configuration files to specify target networks, scan options, and reporting preferences.

### Usage

Start the agent with the configured parameters to initiate the scanning process. Monitor the progress through the logs and wait for the completion of the scan and report generation.
      
      python agent.py start
